# PYTHON PROJECTS
The repository contains the various small projects that I made using python.
## Dobble Game
The first project is a Dobble game- This is game where we are given two cards and the code need to give common objects present in both the cards. I accomplished the task using python in the code.
## Speech to Text
The second project is the code for Speech to text converter. The code efficiently converts a given audio files to its respective text format. The code uses google speech recognition and only takes into
account .wav format which is high audio quality format. The link to the Sample audio file used in the code is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavanelisetty/sample-audio-files-for-speech-recognition
